# ADM-HW2
This repository contains the source code, notebooks, and additional materials related to Assignment 2 of the "Algorithms for Data Mining" course (23/24) from the Data Science Master's program at Sapienza University of Rome. Below, you will find an overview of the contents of thisÂ repository.



## Description
In this assignment, we are analyzing a substantial dataset of books with the aim of extracting valuable insights by addressing specific research questions. This process is designed to provide useful information about the dataset.

The analysis was done to answer the following questions:

  - 8 Research questions: Analysis using Pandas library.
  - Bonus question: Analysis using Dask library.
  - Command Line Question (CLQ): Analysis using command line only.
  - AWS question: which is a comparison between the local machine and the AWS EC2 instance doing the same analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized in this context comprises metadata about books and their respective authors, available in JSON files accessible via this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/opalskies/large-books-metadata-dataset-50-mill-entries). To expedite the analysis, we worked with a randomly-sampled, lighter version of the data, which can be found here [lighter_authors.json](https://adm2023.s3.amazonaws.com/lighter_authors.json) and [lighter_books.json](https://adm2023.s3.amazonaws.com/lighter_books.json), aiming to reduce the time required for analysis.
